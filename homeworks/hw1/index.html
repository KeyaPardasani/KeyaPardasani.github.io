           Hi! My name is Keya Pardasani and I am a second year at Berkeley! I am really passionate about the environment and sustainable fashion, so if you ever need a thrifting buddy, I'm there! I also love anything outdoors, especially hiking, running, and exploring. One day I want to travel to all 7 continents!

            My favorite restaurants in Berkeley are...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Berkeley Thai House</li>
            <li>Organic Greens</li>
            <li>Dyar</li>
          </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>I learned that there are more factors that cause a design to be made than I thought. A lot more careful placement is made to make the user more engaged.</li>
            <li>I really liked the breakdown of the apps and how the author observed their choices. I would have never noticed the details added to certain phrases and why certain things are linked and why others are not. This gave me a new perspective on my social media apps.</li>
            <li>This was an interesting observation: "The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting"</li>
