					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I never considered the implications of accessability in product design. I always new this was something to address, but I didn't realize how impactful it is. Now i understand that this should be addressed through contrast, relying on more than color, and documenting and socializing color systems.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> While this is a serious issue, I liked the humor in the article. It bluntly tells you to think about accessability and the ways you can. It was also super engaging and I learned a lot about the minor details that can make a difference. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.”</p>
						</li>
