							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that design is very calculated and researched. I know that as humans, there are many psychological factors that effect our attention. But I didn't realize that small design elements like white spaces, fonts, and tones, were planned out. From this article, I also learned what the Cocktail party effect (the ability to tune into a single voice and tune out all others during a crowded party) is. </p>
