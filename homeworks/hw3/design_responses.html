							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how there is many considerations when choosing a style. I didn't know that styles of font had certain implications, so I learned that researching them is best to do before using them. I also learned about a useful tool called the Modular Scale that I can use in my projects. I also now know to create a typography styleguide to help be the standard for when I am designing a website. </p>
