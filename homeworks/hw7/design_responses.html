							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned from this article what Gestalt was. I also learned that it is built on four key principles, and these are energence, reification, multi-stability, invariance. Now I understand the importance of these and the way they influence an audience's perspective. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how for each theme, there was a visual association with it, so we could understand the difference it makes. For example, proximitiy was shown in two different mockups, and I could see the difference proximity makes in a website's format. I also liked how the author described the impact it plays and why it is important, for it was very educational and I learned a lot about each theme.  </p>
